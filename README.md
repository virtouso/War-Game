# War-Game
project is at first stages and not ready to use.</br>

It's a Basic Test for Action Game AI and Animation.<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In AI For A Video Game We Always Look For A TradeOff Between Fun And Rational. </br>
Fun: AI as Recreation of Reality or Realistic Pattern, Shouldnt Make The Game Som Simple Or So Hard; It Should Be Challenging<br>
Rational:AI Should be Adopted Based On Knowledge Of Player From Reality.

Tactics:</br>
rules of tactics and formation are many verbal rules that can be translated to a computer program.</br>
these are the options to turn those rules to a computer program:
- Jason,XML
- Fuzzy Logic
- Expert System
- Architectural Techniques Like: behaviour Tree, Utility Teory

"Sun Tzu" has defined the most basic rules of war. These are The Rules:</br>

- Avoid What Is Strong And Strike At What Is Weak.
- Supreme Excellence Consists In Breaking The Enemy's Resistance Whithout Fighting. The Key Is To Know Your Enemy Well.(If The Enemy Is Arrogant, Pretend to be Weak; So He Will Undestimate You. If He's Relaxing, Attack. If They Are United, Seperate Them.)
- If You The Enemy and Know Yourself, You Need Not to Fear The Result Of Hundred Battles.
- All Warfare Is Based On Deception. Hence, When We Are Able To Attack, We Must Seem Unablle; When Using Our Forces, We Must Appear Inactive; When We Are Near, We Must Make The Enemy Believe We Are Far Away; When Far Away, We Must make Him Believe We Are Near.

Behaviour:</br>
As AI Designer Or Programmer, We Need To Structure The Code For Behaviour Of Character, Actor, Agent...
For Realism, Every Character Should Have a Sensory System And a Database. 
A Database Is All Knowledge of Character from Environment And Other Stuff Including:</br>
  - being in a team or not.
  - at offence or defence.
  - health
  - capablities and freedom
  - state(in action, patrol, idle,...)
  - number of enemies and number of team-mates
  - ...
  
  Sensory System Including Eyesight, Sound or Some Scripted or Hardcoded Stuff Update this Senory System. Some Times Sensory System Is More General And is Shared In All Groups All Player Enemies or in a Squad. The Data Is Fed To Structured Code To Performe any Wanted Behaviour. 
- State Machine: limited but suitable for a simple agents. there are extensions like HSFM to reduces limitations.
- GOAP: a series os action/result to achieve a  final goal
- Behavioural Tree:  a tree that leafs are actions and the algorithm searchs in the tree base of feedback from result of leaves
- Utility Teory: most generic way to make a behaviour for the character based on value of a certain action in a defined condition.
