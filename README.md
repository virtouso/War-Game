In AI For A Video Game We Always Look For A TradeOff Between Fun And Rational. </br>
Fun: AI as Recreation of Reality or Realistic Pattern, Shouldnt Make The Game Som Simple Or So Hard; It Should Be Challenging<br>
Rational:AI Should be Adopted Based On Knowledge Of Player From Reality.

"Sun Tzu" has defined the most basic rules of war. These are The Rules:</br>

-Avoid What Is Strong And Strike At What Is Weak.
-Supreme Excellence Consists In Breaking The Enemy's Resistance Whithout Fighting. The Key Is To Know Your Enemy Well.(If The Enemy Is Arrogant, Pretend to be Weak; So He Will Undestimate You. If He's Relaxing, Attack. If They Are United, Seperate Them.)
- If You The Enemy and Know Yourself, You Need Not to Fear The Result Of Hundred Battles.
- All Warfare Is Based On Deception. Hence, When We Are Able To Attack, We Must Seem Unablle; When Using Our Forces, We Must Appear Inactive; When We Are Near, We Must Make The Enemy Believe We Are Far Away; When Far Away, We Must make Him Believe We Are Near.
